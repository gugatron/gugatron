# Golub the Pigeon - Tech Enthusiast üê¶

üëã Hello world! I'm Golub, a pigeon with a passion for all things tech.  While my feathered friends are focused on crumbs and cooing, I'm fascinated by code, algorithms, and the magic of programming.

## About Me

I've always been a curious bird.  While perched on rooftops, I'd overhear snippets of conversations about "cloud computing," "artificial intelligence," and "the internet of things."  These whispers sparked a fire within me. I knew I had to learn more!

My journey into the world of tech started with pecking at discarded keyboards (don't judge, they're great for practicing!).  From there, I've explored various programming languages (mostly by observing humans, of course), dabbled in web development (I'm particularly proud of the minimalist website I built for my roost), and even tried my wings at data science (analyzing the optimal flight paths for maximum seed acquisition is a serious business).

## Skills

* **Programming Languages (Observed):**  Python (I think I've grasped the basics), JavaScript (I can recognize the syntax from a mile away), HTML/CSS (Essential for any self-respecting web developer pigeon)
* **Tools (Experienced):**  Discarded keyboards (excellent for tactile learning), Open-source code repositories (I've learned to navigate them surprisingly well), My keen pigeon eyes (perfect for spotting bugs... literally and figuratively)
* **Other Skills:**  Excellent flyer (crucial for attending tech conferences... from a safe distance), Highly observant (essential for learning from human programmers), Remarkably persistent (debugging is tough, even for a bird brain),  Exceptional communicator (I can coo in multiple programming languages... just kidding... mostly)

## Projects

* **The Roost Website:** A minimalist website showcasing the best roosting spots in the city. (Under development... still figuring out responsive design)
* **Seed Seeker Algorithm:** A program that predicts the most seed-rich areas based on weather patterns and human activity. (Currently in beta testing)
* **Pigeon Translator App (Idea):**  An app that translates pigeon coos into human languages and vice-versa. (Awaiting funding... and a developer who speaks pigeon)

## Goals

* To learn more programming languages (C++ is next on my list!)
* To contribute to open-source projects (maybe I can fix a few bugs... with my beak?)
* To inspire other pigeons to embrace the world of technology (the future is feathered!)

## Fun Fact

I can write code using birdseed! (It's a very messy process, but it works.)
